				<p>Git is a open source distribution control system. It allows every person working on a project to have a copy of the main server allowing there to be back ups if there is a server corruption. Also allows them to work on the projects in there own way and bring the projects together. Git was invented by Linus Torvalds.</p>
        <p>Hub allows people to use Github in a better way. It makes using Github much easier and adds commands to git to help with creation process.</P>
        <p>A repository is a directory. Its role is to be a storage space. Basically it allows project to be updated in the live version which is the one of githubs serversm, or it can be updated through saving the file itself and editing localing on your computer. </p>
        <p>Over all I believe that is a good resource for developers. It allows people to post there working a location that they can get to easily. As well it allows developers to have a location to find people to test there builds.</p>
